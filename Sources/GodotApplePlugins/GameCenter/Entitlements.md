But generally, what you want is:

1. To have a App ID identifier for your project that is configured
with the entitlement, to do this, go to your developer account on
developer.apple.com and navigate to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles".

2. Create an identifier, or pick an existing identifier

3. Make sure that "Game Center" is enabled for that identifier.

### Adding the Entitlement to the Godot Mac Editor.

If you download the Mac binary from the Godot web site, you will need
to add the entitlement to that binary.  Since it already comes with a
bundle identifier, you will need to both change the identifier to the
one you created and resign the package.

TODO: document steps for this, I just asked Claude to do it for me.
